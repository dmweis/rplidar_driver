This driver is based on [rplidar.rs](https://github.com/cnwzhjs/rplidar.rs) by [cnwzhjs](https://github.com/cnwzhjs) with some merges from [A fork](https://github.com/RoboticsTeam4904/rplidar.rs) by [RoboticsTeam4904](https://github.com/RoboticsTeam4904).

## Introduction

If you want a general rust driver for slamtec products you should use the original [rplidar.rs](https://github.com/cnwzhjs/rplidar.rs)

If you are using ROS (Robot Operating System), please use our open-source [ROS node](https://github.com/slamtec/rplidar_ros) directly

If you are just evaluating RPLIDAR, you can use [Slamtec RoboStudio](https://www.slamtec.com/robostudio) (currently only support Windows) to do the evaulation.
